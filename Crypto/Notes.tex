Since computers aren't the best at storing arbitrary reals, we usually use integers, which is how \textbf{number theory} gets involved. Encryption/Hashing is basically a function that maps integers to integers, in a way that is hard to reverse.

Furthermore, having extremely large integers would make computing extremely long, so we use finite groups to avoid having overly large numbers, which involves some \textbf{abstract algebra}.

Nowadays, elliptic curves cryptography and variants are getting quite popular. The theory behind elliptic curves have only been formulated in the mid-1900, largely from the work of the mathematician Grothendieck, who effectively kick-started \textbf{algebraic geometry}. This topic is rather math heavy so try not to have high hopes on understanding the topic in a few years(it's usually taught in math grad school for reference). 

As quantum computing is getting more powerful and more accurate nowadays, quantum-resistant cryptography are also getting more important. This new form of cryptography encompasses many different ideas, from classical cryptography(not using quantum properties) such as lattices to isogeny, to quantum cryptography that uses several interesting properties of quantum systems that classical systems cannot replicate.

\chapter{Number theory}
Number theory is a branch of mathematics dedicated to studying integers and equations involving integer solutions.
\section{Divisibility and primes}
The notion of divisibility and remainder appears, often implicitly, everywhere in cryptography. This section introduces the basic notion of divisibility and remainder.

\begin{theorem}
	Division theorem
	
	Given some $a,b$, with $b>0$, there is a unique solution to $a=qb+r$, where $0\leq r<|b|$.
\end{theorem}
This is quite simple to proof, and the uniqueness is proven by contradiction.

The \textbf{greatest common divisor(GCD)} of $a$ and $b$ is the largest natural number that divides $a$ and $b$. $q$ is called the \textbf{quotient} and $r$ is called the \textbf{remainder}.

A extremely simple algorithm, coming all the way from Euclid, is the \textbf{Euclidean algorithm}. The algorithm has a simple recursive definition:

$$r_{-2}=a\quad r_{-1}=b$$
$$r_{k-2}=q_kr_{k-1}+r_k\quad\text{from the division theorem}$$
This stops when $r_N=0$, and $r_{N-1}$ is the GCD.

A worked example for $a=1113$ and $b=812$ is given below(this case was specially chosen, the algorithm usually converges a lot faster):

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
	k&eqn&$q$ and $r$\\\hline
	-2&&$r_{-2}=1113$\\\hline
	-1&&$r_{-1}=812$\\\hline
	0&$1113=812q_0+r_0$&$q_0=1,r_0=301$\\\hline
	1&$812=301q_1+r_1$&$q_1=2,r_1=210$\\\hline
	2&$301=210q_2+r_2$&$q_2=1,r_2=91$\\\hline
	3&$210=91q_3+r_3$&$q_3=2,r_3=28$\\\hline
	4&$91=28q_4+r_4$&$q_4=3,r_4=7$\\\hline
	5&$28=7q_5+r_5$&$q_5=4,r_5=0$\\\hline
\end{tabular}

Thus the GCD is $7$.

By reversing this algorithm, we also get solutions to a linear diophantine equation.

\begin{theorem}
	B\'ezout's identity
	
	Given some $a,b$, there is exactly one solution to $xa+yb=\gcd(a,b)=d,|x|\leq|\frac{b}{d}|,|y|\leq|\frac{a}{d}|$. Other solutions to this equations are of the form $\left(x-k\frac{b}{d},y+k\frac{a}{d}\right)$
\end{theorem}
The proof of existence is simple, by solving for $x,y$ using the extended euclidean algorithm. $(x,y)$ are usually referred to as the \textbf{B\'ezout's coefficients} Using $a=1113$ and $b=812$:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
	k&eqn&$q$ and $r$\\\hline
	0&$1113=812q_0+r_0$&$q_0=1,r_0=301$\\\hline
	1&$812=301q_1+r_1$&$q_1=2,r_1=210$\\\hline
	2&$301=210q_2+r_2$&$q_2=1,r_2=91$\\\hline
	3&$210=91q_3+r_3$&$q_3=2,r_3=28$\\\hline
	4&$91=28q_4+r_4$&$q_4=3,r_4=7$\\\hline
	5&$28=7q_5+r_5$&$q_5=4,r_5=0$\\\hline
\end{tabular}

Now we `reverse' the algorithm by starting off with eqn 4, then continuously substitute in the previous equations.
\begin{align*}
7&=91-28\cdot3\\
7&=91-\left(210-91\cdot2\right)\cdot3\\
7&=91\cdot7-210\cdot3\\
7&=(301-210\cdot1)\cdot7-210\cdot3\\
7&=301\cdot7-210\cdot10\\
7&=301\cdot7-(812-301\cdot2)\cdot10\\
7&=(1113-812\cdot1)\cdot27-812\cdot10\\
7&=1113\cdot27-812\cdot37\\
\end{align*}
which are the B\'ezout's coefficients$(27,-37)$

Another key aspect of number theory is the concept of \textbf{prime numbers}. A prime number is simply a number that is only divisible by $1$ and itself. The first few primes are:
$$2,3,5,7,11,13,\dots$$
This may seem pretty simple but primes appear very often, especially in analytic number theory(if anyone wants to have some fun there).

Numbers that are not prime are called \textbf{composite numbers}. These numbers are a product of primes(if they aren't they will be primes itself). We call the representation of a number as a product of primes the \textbf{prime factorization}. This comes with quite a obvious but important theorem:

\begin{theorem}
	Prime factorization is unique
\end{theorem}

A important fact about primes is that for any composite number, it's prime factorization is unique. This can easily be proven by contradiction and using the fact primes are unique.

Now for a general composite number, suppose we want to count the number of integers below and coprime to itself. This function is known as the Euler's totient function($\phi(n)$). It is pretty tedious to count one at a time, however, with the prime factorization, there's a formula that relies on prime factorization(Euler's product formula):

$$\phi(n)=n\prod_{p|n}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)$$

The proof of this requires $2$ easier to proof facts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If $m\perp n$, then $\phi(mn)=\phi(m)\phi(n)$
	\item For any prime $p$, $\phi(p^k)=p^k\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)$
\end{enumerate}
The first part is proven by showing that if $a\perp m$ and $b\perp n$, then $an+bm\perp mn$, and that the other direction holds too.

The second part is done by finding all the numbers that aren't coprime to $p^k$.

Finally using the fact prime factorization is unique, the Euler's product formula is proven.
\section{Modular arithmetic}

\emph{The proofs in this section requires some group theory, so its best to just look through the basics, and revisit this section later on.}

Usually, we are not so interested in the entire number, but just the remainder after being divided by some number. This is the idea of modular arithmetic, i.e. after every operation, we take the remainder.

For example in $\mod5$:
$$1+2\equiv3$$
$$1-2\equiv4$$
$$4\cdot2\equiv3$$
$$\frac{3}{4}\equiv2$$

Notice that division is also possible. However, this may not always be possible. The idea of modular division is given $\frac{a}{b}$, we want to find a number $c$ such that $a\equiv bc$, similar to normal division. In fact, with B\'ezout's identity, this is rather simple to solve.

$$\frac{1}{b}\equiv c\pmod n$$
$$bc\equiv 1\pmod n$$
$$cb+kn=1$$
So when $\gcd(b,n)=1$, this is always solvable, with $(c,k)$ as the B\'ezout's coefficients. $c$ is known as the \textbf{modular multiplicative inverse}

In modular arithmetic, modular exponents are quite interesting, with a lot of theorems associated with it, due to its structure as a abelian group. For example,

$$5^6\equiv5\pmod11$$

Now, if you were given $5^x\equiv5\pmod11$, this becomes quite intimidating rather quickly, since our notion of the real numbered log is gone. This is known as the \textbf{discrete log problem}. Fortunately there are some theorems that can assist in solving this problem. 

\begin{theorem}
	Wilson's theorem
	
	$$(n-1)!\equiv-1\pmod n\Leftrightarrow n\in\mathbb{P}$$
\end{theorem}

The forward implication is quite simple, if $n\notin\mathbb{P}$, there exists $a$ integer $a$ such that $a<n$ and $a|n$, so $\frac{n}{a}$ is an integer and $a\cdot\frac{n}{a}\equiv0\pmod n$.

The backwards implication is slightly trickier. 

When $n=2$, the result is trivial, so only odd primes are considered.

For every $a<n$, a unique multiplicative inverse, $a^{-1}$, exists. 

If $a\equiv a^{-1}\pmod n$, then $a^2\equiv 1\pmod n$, and $(a+1)(a-1)\equiv 0\pmod n$. Since $a<n$ and $n$ is prime, the only way this is possible is when $a=1$ or $a=n-1$, thus all numbers, between $2$ and $n-2$(inclusive) have a different unique multiplicative inverse.

The factors of $(p-2)!$ all results in $1\pmod n$. Multiplying this by $(p-1)$, we get $(p-1)!\equiv-1\pmod p$. Therefore the backwards implication is proven.

\begin{theorem}
	Fermat little theorem
	
	If $p$ is a prime number, then$a^p\equiv a\pmod p$. Alternatively, $a^{p-1}\equiv1\pmod p$ if $a\perp p$
\end{theorem}
The idea behind this is that there are $p-1$ elements in $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$, since $p$ is prime, every integer except $0$ satisfies the group axioms. A simple proof involves considering the sequence

$$a,2a,3a,\dots,(p-1)a$$
This sequence is simply a rearrangement of 
$$1,2,3,\dots,p-1$$
if $a\neq 0\pmod p$(simple proof by contradiction)

Now we consider the product of both sequences
$$a^{p-1}(p-1)!\equiv(p-1)!\pmod p$$
By Wilson's theorem,
$$-a^{p-1}\equiv-1\pmod p$$
$$a^{p-1}\equiv1\pmod p$$
And the case where $a\equiv0\pmod p$ is trivial.

Notice this only works for primes. There exists a more general theorem that works for all integers:
\begin{theorem}
	Euler's theorem
	
	If $n\perp a$, then $$a^{\phi(n)}\equiv1\pmod n$$
\end{theorem}
Here $\phi(n)$ is the Euler's totient function.

\section{Introduction}
RSA is a private key cryptography algorithm that relies on prime factorization being hard.

The algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Generate $2$ distinct primes, $p$ and $q$
	\item Let $n=pq$
	\item Compute either $o=\phi(n)$ or $\lambda(n)$
	\item Choose $1<e<o$, such that $\gcd(e,o)=0$
	\item Calculate $d$ such that $ed=1\pmod o$
	\item Public: $n,e$\\Private: $p,q,o,d$
	\item To encrypt $m$, calculate $c=m^e\mod n$
	\item To decrypt $c$, calculate $m=c^d\mod n$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Variants}
\subsection{Speed up}
Sometimes to speed up decryption, CRT is used to compute $\tmod n$.

Let $d_p=d\pmod{p-1}$, $d_q=d\pmod{q-1}$
$$m_p\equiv c^d\equiv c^{d_p}\pmod p$$
$$m_q\equiv c^d\equiv c^{d_q}\pmod q$$
Define $h$ as $m=m_q+qh$(by CRT). Now consider $m\pmod p$.
$$m_q+qh\equiv m_p\pmod p$$
$$h\equiv q^{-1}\left(m_p-m_q\right)\pmod p$$
